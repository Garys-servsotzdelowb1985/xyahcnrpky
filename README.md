Wow, just watched Demon City and, like, what did I even just see? Honestly, it’s like if you took every neon color you can think of, painted it over a nightmare, and then set everything on fire. But in a good way, I think? You know what it feels like? A fever dream where you're half-scared, half-HYPED with all that action. 

Seriously, the characters, though! Like, is everyone in that world secretly an acrobat or ninja? I swear, every time someone gets into a fight, they do these wild flips and I'm just sitting here like, yep, I'd trip just getting off my couch.” And the city itself, lol, I can't decide if it's cool or cursed. Most every building looks like it would collapse if you looked at it wrong.

> And the plot! I mean, what was the plot? One minute there's this super evil dude trying to end the world or something, and the next, there's some mystical thingamajig everyone needs. I was kinda lost, but then again, maybe I'm just too tired to follow along. I stayed up way too late to download the movie.

Anyway, I gotta say, the music? Total banger. It’s like it was making fun of how dark and gloomy the rest was. I might just listen to it on repeat when I need a boost. But yeah, after watching the movie, I couldn't stop thinking about how wild animation can get in these things. Like, the animation team? They deserve a high-five—or a nap, maybe.

People in this movie act like gravity only applies like 30% of the time and yet, I’m over here thinking, “Man, my knees ache just watching this.” Props to them, though; they make it look easy! 

let randomNumber = Math.random(); // honestly, I have no clue why I even typed this here.

Alright, I should probably crash. My brain’s like, Did I really just spend two hours on that? And yeah, I did, and I’d probably do it again. So, when you decide to check it out, lemme know. We gotta chat more about those bonkers plot twists, haha. Alright, night!
